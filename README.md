## Web Developer 

I'm a full-stack web developer with 5+ years of experience, focused on crafting clean, responsive, and user-friendly websites and applications.  
I specialize in front-end development with a strong foundation in PHP, WordPress, and JavaScript.
I enjoy learning new things and never shy away from a challenge. Whether it’s a new framework, tool, or coding concept — I’m always up for it.
I'm currently focusing on learning the Go programming language and React.js, as well as gaining a basic understanding of containerization and orchestration tools.
